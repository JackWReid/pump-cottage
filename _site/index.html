		<h1>Welcome to Pump Cottage.</h1>

		<p class="page-home__panel__opener">If you are looking for the perfect getaway, a base for touring the beautiful Jurassic Coast, or simply a place in which to chill and unwind, then our luxury bed and breakfast, Pump Cottage, or our self-contained, one bedroom home, Pump Lodge, are the ideal choice.</p>

		<p>Pump Cottage is set on the edge of the lovely village of Upwey (with its ancient folie Wishing Well); local sites include the local Wishing Well Tea Room and St Laurence Church, which dates back to the 13th century. Situated in an area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, we are just four miles from Dorchester and Weymouth seafront, as well as the picturesque Abbotsbury. The Inner South West Coast Path and Wey Valley Walks are in close proximity.

		<p>Pump Cottage has just undergone a major refurbishment and we are proud to offer the highest standard of luxury accommodation in a peaceful, tranquil setting. Our exquisite rooms boast views of the outstanding countryside.</p>

		<p>Our garden is a haven for wildlife including pheasants, deer, and an array of different birds. The local farms also rear either sheep or cows, which you can sight in the adjacent fields.</p>

		<p>Pump Cottage and Pump Lodge are run by Sue and Paul, who are both passionate about providing excellent customer service, whether serving up a delicious breakfast, or advising on things to do in the local area. We look forward to welcoming you, either to our luxury bed and breakfast at Pump Cottage, or to your own private holiday home at Pump Lodge.</p>
