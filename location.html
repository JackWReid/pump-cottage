		<h2>By Car</h2>
		<p>Pump Cottage is a red brick Edwardian house, to the east of a large red brick Edwardian Pumping Station. It is situated about half a mile along Friar Waddon Road when travelling from Upwey.</p>


		<p>From Exeter/Honiton/Bridport, travelling on the A35 to Dorchester, turn right at Winterbourne Abbas opposite a Murco garage on the B3159 to Martinstown (Winterbourne St Martin). Continue on this road for about 3 miles; on passing the sign to Upwey, take the next right - this should be Friar Waddon Road.</p>

		<p>From the A35 travelling from Bournemouth, turn left onto the A354 towards Weymouth. Continue on this road for about 2 miles until the signpost exit to Upwey. Follow the road around onto the Dorchester Road and within 500 yards, turn right into Elwell Street. Follow the road to the bottom and turn right at the T junction. Follow the road through the village of Upwey, continuing up the hill. Turn left when you sight the signpost signalling Portesham and Coryates. You should then be on Friar Waddon Road, and we are half a mile along this road on the right-hand side.</p>

		<h2>By Train</h2>
		<p>Our nearest train station is Upwey, which is 5 minutes away by car. Alternatively, you can travel into Weymouth train station, which is 15 minutes away by car.</p>

		<h2>By Bus</h2>
		<p>We're only a 5 minute walk from Upwey village, which you can easily get to by bus. If travelling from Weymouth or Dorchester, catch the number 10 bus towards Upwey. It runs every 20 minutes from Monday to Friday, and every 30 minutes on weekends.</p>
