    <p>We are a red brick house, to the east of a large red brick Victorian Pumping Station, situated about half a mile along Friar Waddon Road from the Upwey end. From Exeter/Honiton/Bridport travelling on the A35 to Dorchester turn right at Winterbourne Abbas opposite a B.P garage on the B3159 to Martinstown (Winterbourne St Martin). Continue on this road for about 3 miles; on passing the sign to Upwey take the next right - this should be Friar Waddon Road.</p>
    <p>From A35 travelling from Bournemouth turn left onto the A999 Towards Weymouth. Continue on this road for about 2 miles until the signpost exit to Upwey. Follow the road around onto the Dorchester Road and within 500 yards turn right into Elwell Street. Follow the road to the bottom and turn right at the T junction. Follow the road through the village of Upwey up the hill to the turning on the left signposted Portesham and Coryates- Friar Waddon Road and we are half a mile along the road on the right.</p>
