		<h1>Pump View</h1>

		<p>Pump View is a one bedroom, en-suite studio situated on the top floor of a cosy cabin that is nestled in the Dorset countryside. Sue and Paul look after Pump View which is sat in the grounds of their luxury B&amp;B, Pump Cottage. They will be on hand next door should you have any questions about the area during your stay.</p>

		<p>Pump View has its own private entrance so you can come and go from the property as you please.</p>

		<p>The double bedroom is situated on the first floor where you can look out over beautiful views of the surrounding garden and rolling hills, which are recognised as an area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.</p>

		<p>The en-suite studio contains a double bed, a pair of armchairs, a dining area with two chairs, a chest of drawers, a fitted wardrobe and a HD TV with DVD player. Free WiFi is available. We love the quirky sloping ceilings in our cabin, but please bear this in mind if you are tall!</p>

		<p>The bathroom includes a toilet, hand-bowl, cabinet, mirror, and shower. Please note that the entrance to the shower is 40cm wide. The shower cubicle itself is 67cm across. Towels and linens are provided, as well as an electric hairdryer.</p>

		<p>The price advertised is room only. If you wish to have continental breakfast brought to your room each morning then please let us know and this can be arranged (additional fee of Â£5 per person, per day). There are coffee and tea making facilities in the studio, including an electric kettle.</p>

		<p>It's free to park outside the property.</p>
