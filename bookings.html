		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

		<p><strong>Is breakfast included for every room?</strong><br>
		Breakfast is included in the price if you are staying in one of the bedrooms within Pump Cottage. By contrast, Pump View is a room only booking, which means that cooked breakfast in the Pump Cottage dining area is not available. However, a continental breakfast is available in Pump View as room service for a surcharge of £5 per person, per breakfast. Pump Lodge is a self-catered holiday let, therefore breakfast is not provided.</p>

		<p><strong>When can I check-in / check-out of the property?</strong><br>
		You can check-in any time between 4pm and 7pm. Please check-out before 10am.</p>

		<p><strong>What is your policy regarding pets?</strong><br>
		Unfortunately, pets are not accepted at neither Pump Cottage, Pump Lodge, nor Pump View.</p>

		<p><strong>What is your policy regarding children?</strong><br>
		Children of all ages are welcome to stay at Pump Lodge. However we are only able to offer accommodation for children aged 12 and above in Pump Cottage and Pump View.</p>

		<p><strong>Do you accept credit / debit card payments?</strong><br>
		We do accept credit card payments from all major credit cards, excluding American Express.</p>

		<p><strong>How can I pay if I book with you directly?</strong><br>
		If booking directly with Sue or Paul via phone or e-mail, we ask that you pay by either cash, cheque or card on arrival.</p>

		<p><strong>Who do I make cheque payments out to?</strong><br>
		If paying by cheque, please make out all payments to Mrs Sue Moore.</p>

		<p><strong>What is your cancellation policy?</strong><br>
		We operate a moderate cancellation policy, which means that guests will receive a 50% refund of the total cost (minus the booking fee ) if they cancel at least 14 days before the start of the holiday. Any cancellation made within 14 days of your check-in date will not be refunded.</p>

		<p><strong>Do I have to pay a security deposit?</strong><br>
		We request that guests pay a security deposit of £60 when they book to stay at Pump Lodge, in case of any damage done to the property during their stay. Guests should be refunded this deposit in full upon checkout should there be no damage.</p>
