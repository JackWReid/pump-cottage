		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

		<p><strong>When can I check-in / check-out of the property?</strong><br>
		You can check-in any time between 4pm and 7pm. Please check-out before 10am.</p>

		<p><strong>What is your policy regarding pets?</strong><br>
		Unfortunately, pets are not accepted at either Pump Cottage or Pump Lodge.</p>

		<p><strong>What is your policy regarding children?</strong><br>
		Children of all ages are welcome to stay at Pump Lodge. However, due to the facilities available at Pump Cottage and the fact that we do not have any family rooms, we are only able to offer accommodation for children aged 12 and above.</p>

		<p><strong>Do you accept credit / debit card payments?</strong><br>
		At this time we do not accept debit or credit card payments, unless you book with us via a third party (Late Rooms, AirBnB etc).</p>

		<p><strong>How can I pay if I book with you directly?</strong><br>
		If booking directly with Sue or Paul via phone or e-mail, we ask that you pay by either cash or cheque on arrival. We will also request a non-refundable £25 booking deposit to be sent in the post, via either cash or cheque.</p>

		<p><strong>Who do I make cheque payments out to?</strong><br>
		If paying by cheque, please make out all payments to Mrs Sue Moore.</p>

		<p><strong>What is your cancellation policy?</strong><br>
		We operate a moderate cancellation policy, which means that guests will receive a 50% refund of the total cost (minus the booking fee ) if they cancel at least four weeks before the start of the holiday.</p>

		<p><strong>Do I have to pay a security deposit?</strong><br>
		We request that guests pay a security deposit of £62 when they book to stay at Pump Lodge, in case of any damage done to the property during their stay. Guests will be refunded this deposit in full upon checking out should there be no damage.</p>
