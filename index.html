    <p>Pump Cottage is set on the edge of the lovely village of Upwey (with its ancient folie Wishing Well) and situated in an area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, four miles Dorchester and Weymouth and picturesque Abbotsbury. We are very near the Inner South West Coast Path and surrounded by the Wey Valley Walks and only four miles.</p>
    <p>Pump Cottage has just undergone a major refurbishment and we are offering a high standard of luxury accommodation in a peaceful, tranquil setting with views over the outstanding countryside and within a half mile walk to the village of Upwey and the local 'Wishing Well Tea Room' and St Laurence Church dating back to the 18th Century.</p>
    <p>Our garden is a haven for wildlife including pheasants, deer, an array of different birds as well as the local farms rearing either sheep or cows in the adjacent fields.</p>
    <p>We look forward to welcoming you to our home - Pump Cottage and holiday home Pump Lodge.</p>
